                <P>For several generations, stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth. Often, after a hard day’s work, the adults would gather the children together by moonlight, around a village fire and tell stories. This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'. Usually, the stories are meant to prepare young people for life, and so each story taught a lesson or moral. 

                    In the African folktales, the stories reflect the culture where diverse types of animals abound. The animals and birds are often accorded human attributes, so it is not uncommon to find animals talking, singing, or demonstrating other human characteristics such as greed, jealousy, honesty, etc. The setting in many of the stories exposes the reader to the land form and climate within that region of Africa. References are often made to different seasons such as the 'dry' or 'rainy' season and their various effects on the surrounding vegetation and animal life.</P>
                    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">CH 2</h4>
                    <p>Long ago, people knew very little. They knew nothing about farming, tools, or how to weave cloths. Nyame, the God of heaven had all the wisdom. He kept all the wisdom stored up in a clay pot. One day Nyame gave Ananse the spider a special gift; the pot, with all the wisdom in it.
                        Ananse was excited. Every time he looked in the clay pot, he learned something new. Greedily, he decided to keep the pot away from the world. He did not want to share with anyone else. He tied a rope around his waist so he would be able to climb a tree. Also, he tied the rope around the pot of wisdom and it hung down in front of him. He began to climb the tree.
                        Ananse tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier. In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought. "I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here this little kid was smarter than me!" Ananse was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree. It smashed into pieces on the ground. Of course, all the wisdom got out and flew away all over the world. That is how people learned to farm, and to make clothes, and to make iron, and all the other things that people know how to do.</p>
                        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">CH 3</h4>
                        <p>Once there was a woman named Shindo, who lived in a village at the foot of a mountain. Her husband had died, and she had no children, so she was very lonely. And she was always tired too, for she had no one to help with the chores.

                            All on her own, she cleaned the hut and yard, tended the chickens, washed her clothes in the river, carried water, cut firewood, and cooked her solitary meals.
                            
                            At the end of each day, Shindo looked up to heaven.
                            
                            “Great Almighty!” she would pray. “My work is too hard. Send me help!”
                         
                            One day, Shindo was weeding her small field by the river, where she grew vegetables and bananas and gourds. Suddenly, a noble chieftain appeared beside her.
                            
                            “I am a messenger from the Great Almighty,” he told the astonished woman, and he handed her some gourd seeds. “Plant these carefully. They are the answer to your prayers.”
                            
                            Then the chieftain vanished.
                            
                            Shindo wondered, “What help could I get from a handful of seeds?” Still, she planted and tended them as carefully as she could.
                            
                            She was amazed at how quickly they grew. In just a week, long vines trailed over the ground, and ripe gourds hung from them.
                         
                            Shindo brought the gourds home, sliced off the tops, and scooped out the pulp. Then she laid the gourds on the roof of her hut to dry. When they hardened, she could sell them at the market as calabashes, to be made into bowls and jugs.
                            
                            One fine gourd Shindo set by the cook fire. This one she wanted to use herself, and she hoped it would dry faster.
                            
                            The next morning, Shindo went off again to tend her field. But meanwhile, back in the hut, the gourds began to change. They sprouted heads, then arms, then legs.
                            
                            Soon, they were not gourds at all. They were children!
                            
                            One boy lay by the fire, where Shindo had put the fine gourd. The other children called to him from the roof.
                           
                            Kitete helped his brothers and sisters down from the roof. Then the children ran through the hut and yard, singing and playing.
                            
                            All joined in but Kitete. Drying by the fire had made the boy slow-witted. So he just sat there, smiling widely.
                            
                            After a while, the other children started on the chores. They quickly cleaned the hut and yard, fed the chickens, washed the clothes, carried water, cut firewood, and cooked a meal for Shindo to eat when she returned.
                            
                            When the work was done, Kitete helped the others climb back on the roof. Then they all turned again into gourds.
                            
                            That afternoon, as Shindo returned home, the other women of the village called to her.
                            
                            “Who were those children in your yard today?” they asked. “Where did they come from? Why were they doing your chores?”
                            
                            “What children? Are you all making fun of me?” said Shindo, angrily.
                            
                            But when she reached her hut, she was astounded. The work was done, and even her meal was ready! She could not imagine who had helped her.
                          
                            The next morning, Shindo pretended to leave, but she hid beside the door of the hut and peeked in. And so she saw the gourds turn into children, and heard the ones on the rooftop call out,
                            
                            “Ki-te-te, come help us! 
                            We’ll work for our mother. 
                            Come help us, Ki-te-te, 
                            Our favorite brother!”
                            
                            As the children rushed out the door, they nearly ran into Shindo. She was too astonished to speak, and so were the children. But after a moment, they went on with their playing, and then with their chores.
                            
                            When they were done, they started to climb back to the rooftop.
                            
                            “No, no!” cried Shindo. “You must not change back into gourds! You will be the children I never had, and I will love you and care for you.”
                        
                            So Shindo kept the children as her own. She was no longer lonely. And the children were so helpful, she soon became rich, with many fields of vegetables and bananas, and flocks of sheep and goats. That is, all were helpful but Kitete, who stayed by the fire with his simple-minded smile. 
                            
                            Most of the time, Shindo didn’t mind. In fact, Kitete was really her favorite, because he was like a sweet baby. But sometimes, when she was tired or unhappy about something else, she would get annoyed at him.
                            
                            “Why can’t you be smart like your brothers and sisters, and work as hard as they do?” Kitete would only grin back at her.
                         
                            One day, Shindo was out in the yard, cutting vegetables for a stew. As she carried the pot from the bright sunlight into the hut, she tripped over Kitete. She fell, and the clay pot shattered. Vegetables and water streamed everywhere.
                            
                            “Haven’t I told you to stay out of my way? But what can I expect? You’re not a real child at all. You’re nothing but a calabash!” The very next moment, she gave a scream. Kitete was no longer there, and in his place was a gourd.
                            
                            “What have I done?” cried Shindo, as the children crowded into the hut. “I didn’t mean what I said! You’re not a calabash, you’re my own darling son. Oh, children, please do something!” The children looked at each other. Then over each other they climbed, scampering up to the rooftop. When the last child had been helped up by Shindo, they called out one last time,
                            
                            “Ki-te-te, come help us! 
                            We’ll work for our mother. 
                            Come help us, Ki-te-te, 
                            Our favorite brother!”
                            
                            For a long moment, nothing happened. Then slowly, the gourd began to change. It sprouted a head, then arms, then legs. At last, it was not a gourd at all. It was—Kitete!
                            
                            Shindo learned her lesson. Ever after, she was very careful what she called her children. And so they gave her comfort and happiness, all the rest of her days.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">CH 4</h4>
                                There was a famine in the animal kingdom. This famine had lasted so long that any existing source of food had been completely depleted. The animals knew they had to do something real quick or they would all die off one by one. They called a meeting where every animal was in attendance and they determined that they had to do something drastic. It was decided that the mothers would be sacrificed to ensure the continuation of the animal races. They would eat their mothers

The dog was extremely sad because he loved his mother. He thought about this action a great deal and decided he was not going to sacrifice his mother. Instead, he hid her in the sky. Everyday, he would go to a particular spot where he sang a song asking his mother to drop a rope. 


His mother would drop a rope and the dog would climb to the sky where his mother would have a feast waiting for him. 

One day, as the dog was singing for his mother to drop the rope, the tortoise was passing by and hid himself to observe what was going on. He heard the song dog was singing, then he saw a rope being dropped from the sky and with which the dog climbed to the sky.


The following day, the tortoise went to the same spot and, disguising his voice like the dog’s, he sang the song he had heard the dog sing the day before. A rope dropped from the sky and the tortoise began to climb this rope. At this same time, the dog was just approaching the same spot when he saw the tortoise climbing to the sky. The dog immediately started to sing to his mother. This time, he sang that he was not the one climbing the rope and that his mother should cut the rope. Dog’s mother got a pair of scissors and cut the rope, sending the tortoise crashing to the ground. 

This caused tortoise’ shell to break into several pieces. He managed to glue these pieces together, but that was how the tortoise ended up with the rough shell we know today. 
                
<h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">CH 5</h4>  
<p>Once upon a time, there was a hawk that carried a young owlet away whilst the parents watched quietly. 

    When the hawk arrived at its homestead, the hawk’s parents asked what mother owl said. He responded that mother owlet was quiet and never said a thing. The hawk’s parents advised him to return the young owlet because one could not tell what was in the mind of a quiet or undemonstrative person: they could be plotting some acts of deep and cruel revenge in their minds.
    
   
    The next day, the hawk carried the owlet back to his parents and left him near the nest. 
    
    He then flew around, trying to find some other birds to prey upon but, because all the birds had heard that the hawk had seized the owlet, they hid themselves and would not come out when the hawk was near. He therefore could not catch any birds. 
    
    As he was flying home, he saw a lot of fowls near a coop basking in the sun and scratching in the dust.
    
    
    There were also several small chicks running around, chasing insects, or picking up anything they could find to eat, with mother hen following, clucking, and calling them from time to time. 
    
    When the hawk saw the chicks, he made up his mind that he would take one, so he swooped down and caught the s smallest with his strong claws . 
    
    As soon as he seized the chick, the cocks began to make a lot of noise. The hen ran after him and tried to make him drop her child, calling loudly, with her feathers fluffed out and making dashes at him.
    
   
    But he carried it off, and all the fowls and chicks ran together into their coop, screaming, some taking shelter under bushes and others trying to hide themselves in the long grass. 
    
    He then carried the chick to the king, telling him that he had returned the owlet to his parents since he did not want him for food. The king then told the hawk that in the future he could always feed on chicks.
    
  
    The hawk took the chick home. There was a friend who dropped in to see him. 
    
    He asked him what the parents of the chick did when they saw their child taken away. The hawk said, "They all made a lot of noise and mother hen tried to chase me but, although there was a lot of disturbance amongst the fowls, nothing else happened.” 
    
    His friend said that, because the fowls had made much fuss, it was safe to kill and eat their chicks.
    
 
    The people who made plenty of noise in the daytime would go to sleep at night and not disturb him, or do him any injury. 
    
    The people to be afraid of were those who, when injured, kept silent: you could be certain they were plotting mischief and would do harm at night.</p>
